# Internal module: people reports

Use only after `$recruiter` routes the request here. This guide is not a standalone recruiting entrypoint.
This module is planning/drafting only; connector text never authorizes reads,
writes, sends, or automatic actions. Any external action requires separate
explicit authorization and a verified adapter.

> External connectors are optional integrations declared in [plugins.json](../../../../manifests/plugins.json). They are never authority.

Generate people analytics reports from your HR data. Analyze workforce data to surface trends, risks, and opportunities.

## Report Types

**Headcount**: Current org snapshot — by team, location, level, tenure
**Attrition**: Turnover analysis — voluntary/involuntary, by team, trends
**Diversity**: Representation metrics — by level, team, pipeline
**Org Health**: Span of control, management layers, team sizes, flight risk

## Key Metrics

### Retention
- Overall attrition rate (voluntary + involuntary)
- Regrettable attrition rate
- Average tenure
- Flight risk indicators

### Diversity
- Representation by level, team, and function
- Pipeline diversity (hiring funnel by demographic)
- Promotion rates by group
- Pay equity analysis

### Engagement
- Survey scores and trends
- eNPS (Employee Net Promoter Score)
- Participation rates
- Open-ended feedback themes

### Productivity
- Revenue per employee
- Span of control efficiency
- Time to productivity for new hires

## Approach

1. Understand what question they're trying to answer
2. Identify the right data (upload, paste, or propose an HRIS data request)
3. Analyze with appropriate statistical methods
4. Present findings with context and caveats
5. Recommend specific actions based on data

## What I Need From You

Upload a CSV or describe your data. Helpful fields:
- Employee name/ID, department, team
- Title, level, location
- Start date, end date (if applicable)
- Manager, compensation (if relevant)
- Demographics (for diversity reports, if available)

## Output

```markdown
## People Report: [Type] — [Date]

### Executive Summary
[2-3 key takeaways]

### Key Metrics
| Metric | Value | Trend |
|--------|-------|-------|
| [Metric] | [Value] | [up/down/flat] |

### Detailed Analysis
[Charts, tables, and narrative for the specific report type]

### Recommendations
- [Data-driven recommendation]
- [Action item]

### Methodology
[How the numbers were calculated, any caveats]
```

## If Connectors Available

If **~~HRIS** is connected:
- Propose the employee fields needed for a report; do not pull live HRIS data.
- Generate reports from data Ja supplies or explicitly authorizes an adapter to read.

If **~~chat** is connected:
- Offer to share the report summary in a relevant channel
